# Outperform
## Description

For this project, I wanted to try and tackle a pain point that every employer and employee of a large organization has run into: Annual Performance Reviews. It always seems that at the end of the year there is a prantic rush to complete every employee review, however most of the information and input is done without much preparation. Enter Outperform. With Outperform, you can routinely append responsibilities to an employee's review and commentate on whether or not they've met those responsibilities.
